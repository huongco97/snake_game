# Snake game
Using Class, Class inheritance, Function, etc. to create the popular Snake game that I played on Nokia since I was a kid.
Steps involved:
- Create a snake body (3 boxes)
- Move the snake
- Control the snake (using up, down, left, right keyboards)
- Detect collision with food
- Create a scoreboard
- Detect collision with wall
- Detect collision with tail

Running the code, the user would be able to play the snake game using keyboards (up, down, left, right), and eat foot to increase the score. If the snake hits the wall or hits itself, the game would stop.
